      <h1>Hello League City,</h1>
      <h3>My name is Greg Gripon and I am running for League City Council position #5.</h3>
      <p>
        I am running for City Council because I believe that League City is truly blessed as one of the most amazing communities in our country! The future of our Historic City holds so much hope, love and growth. League City’s future has so many vibrant dreams just ready to be put into action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day new businesses are seeking out League City for all of our unique assets and potential. Our town is desirable and attractive to new growth. Dealing with this growth takes serious attention in communicating the much needed foresight in planning. We must have knowledgeable, happy employees working for our great city that represent our honest values and looking out for the community's best interest, leaving no stone unturned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planning our future belongs to the community and those who live and play here. As a City Council Member, I will continue my love and dedication towards League City, as I have done for the past 50 years. I will always be accessible with all the citizens of League City. I am an open book that will listen to and hear the desires of all our citizens, and will strive to attend to all the concerns and dreams of League City’s proud community.

          <h2>Growing up in League City</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in League City, Texas. I’m son of Lorene &amp; Lynn Gripon and the brother to Sherri Conner, Randy Gripon &amp; Denise Danner. Proud to be a hometown Clear Creek graduate, class of 1985.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was very involved in the FFA and an active swimmer in the League City Barracudas swim team. I was involved in many youth activities with the city and local organizations. I received many awards in the FFA, as well as the Lone Star Farmer degree and attended the League City United Methodist Church. I became actively involved in the Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce and was instrumental in helping to start up the League City Merchants Business Association which is now better known as the League City Chamber of Commerce and served on its board of directors as Treasurer. I followed my passion and furthered my studies attending college at Texas State Technical Institute (TSTI), where I achieved my Associates Degree in Floriculture and Ornamental Horticulture Technology. While at TSTI, I met the love of my life, LaTonnia Gripon. LaTonnia was attending school for an Associate’s Degree in Floral Design. We were married in 1987 in Marble Falls, Texas, which is her hometown. I bought her back home to League City to settle down and start our life together. In 1991 we were blessed to have our son, Justin Gripon and soon to follow was our daughter, Ashley Gripon in 1995. Our lives were forever changed and blessed beyond measure.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            I was the first graduating class of League City University. I also attended college at Texas State Technical Institute where I achieved my Associates Degree in Floriculture and Ornamental Horticulture Technology. While at TSTI I met my wife LaTonnia Gripon, LaTonnia was in school for an Associates in Floral Design. We were married in 1987 in Marble Falls, TX which is her hometown. I bought her back home to League City to settle down and start our life together. In 1991 we were blessed to have our son Justin Gripon and soon to follow was our daughter Ashley Gripon in 1995, our lives were forever changed and blessed beyond measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never stoped learning. Since collage I graduated for the League City Citizens Police Academy.

          <h2>My father Lynn Gripon</h2>
          <p>
            I was given the great opportunity to raise our children in the same homestead that I grew up in and have been fortunate enough to instill the same great attributes of my father, into our family values. Lynn Gripon was a very humble and giving person that everyone in town dearly loved. He always had a smile on his face and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout and was a graduate of Texas A&amp;M. Lynn graduated in 1949 with a degree in Landscape Architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the monumental Live Oaks trees along Main Street, west of Highway 3, were planted by my father and me. Lynn had the foresight of knowing this would bring the charm to our City and was devoted to serving the community and his profession. Some of the many activities and positions in which he was involved in include: President of Clear Creek High School Wild Cat Booster Club, President of Ross Elementary School's first PTA, President of League City Lions Club (in which, he received the Melvin Jones Award), Chairman of the first League City Parks Board, President of Galveston County A&amp;M Club, President of Texas Association of Nurserymen-Region II, Chairman of the Administration board of the League City Methodist Church, Director of Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, Century Club Member of Texas A&amp;M, member of the 12th Man Foundation of Texas A&amp;M, Honorary member of the League City Garden Club, and Member of the League City Clean and Green Environmental Association. Needless to say, my father was an extremely active person who cared much about the environment his family and friends lived in.

          <h2>Serving the community</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a proud member of the League City Noon Lions Club and have been a member since 1990. My wife joined in 2002, and my son &amp; daughter are both third generation members of the League City Lions; Justin joined in 2012 and Ashley joined the same year she graduated high school, which was 2014. All four of us volunteer each year with the League City Music Festival and BBQ Cook-off, also known as the Village Fair. I have been volunteering with the League City Village Fair for as long as I can remember. I am a former President of the League City Lions Club and received the Melvin Jones and Jack Wiech Fellow and Lion of the Year awards. I am currently still a board member and I have been the Chairman of the Music Festival a number of years.
