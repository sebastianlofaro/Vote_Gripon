      <h1>Hello League City,</h1>
      <h3>My name is Greg Gripon and I am running for League City Council position #5.</h3>
      <p>
        I am running for City Council because I truly believe that League City is one of the most amazing communities in our country! The future of our Historic City holds so much hope, love and Growth!  League City’s future has so many new and fantastic dreams just ready to be put into action.

        Every day new businesses are seeking out League City for all of our unique assets and potential. Our town is desirable and attractive to new growth. Dealing with this growth needs serious attention, communication and planning. We must have knowledgeable, happy employees working for our great city that represent our honest values.

          <h2>Growing up in League City</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised here in League City, TX. The Son of Lynn &amp; Lorene Gripon and the brother to Sherri Conner, Randy Gripon, and Denise Danner. A Home Town Clear Creek graduate class of 1985. I was very involved in the FFA, swim team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up I was an active swimmer in the League City Barracudas swim team. Involved in many youth activities with the city and local organizations. I also received many awards in the FFA, as well as the Lone Star Farmer degree. I was a member of the League City United Methodist Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the first graduating class of League City University. I also attended college at Texas State Technical Institute where I achieved my Associates Degree in Floriculture and Ornamental Horticulture Technology. While at TSTI I met my wife LaTonnia Gripon, LaTonnia was in school for an Associates in Floral Design. We were married in 1987 in Marble Falls, TX which is her hometown. I bought her back home to League City to settle down and start our life together. In 1991 we were blessed to have our son Justin Gripon and soon to follow was our daughter Ashley Gripon in 1995, our lives were forever changed and blessed beyond measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never stoped learning. Since collage I graduated for the League City Citizens Police Academy.

          <h2>My father Lynn Gripon</h2>
          <p>
            I was given the great opportunity to raise our kids in the Gripon Homestead that I grew up in. Instilling the great attributes of my father Lynn Gripon into my family values! Lynn Gripon was a giving person that everyone in town dearly loved, always had a smile on his face. He achieved the rank of Eagle Scout as well was a graduate of Texas A &amp; M.  Lynn graduated in 1949 with a degree in Landscape Architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the Live Oaks planted on Main Street west of Highway 3 were planted by Lynn and myself.  Lynn was devoted to serving his community and profession. Some of the many activities and positions in which he was involved in include: Pres. of Clear Creek High School Wild Cat Booster Club, Pres. of Ross Elementary School's first PTA, Pres. League City Lions Club where he received the Melvin Jones Award, Chairman of the first League City Parks Board, Pres. of Galveston County A & M Club, Pres. of Texas Assoc. of Nurserymen - Region II, Chairman of the Admin board of the League City Methodist Church, Director of Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, Century Club Member of Texas A & M, member of the 12th Man Foundation of Texas A & M, Honorary member of the League City Garden Club, and Member of the League City Clean and Green Environmental Association.
